        <h1>Genocide In Gazza</h1>
        <p>Israeli authorities have intentionally deprived Palestinian civilians in Gaza of adequate access to water since October 2023, most likely resulting in thousands of deaths and thus committing the crime against humanity of extermination and acts of genocide, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today</p>

        <p>BREAKING! UN Commission: Israel is committing genocide in Gaza

Israel is committing genocide in #Gaza, according to a commission established by the United Nations.

A new report says there are reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out since the start of the war in 2023: killing members of a group, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to destroy the group, and preventing births.

It cites statements by Israeli leaders, and the pattern of conduct by Israeli forces, as evidence of genocidal intent.</p>

        <p> ‘Stop starving Gaza. We are closed in solidarity’.

Lush said in a statement: 

"Across the Lush business we share the anguish that millions of people feel seeing the images of starving people in Gaza, Palestine.

Like the rest of the world, we struggle to find ways we can help whilst the Israeli government is preventing urgent humanitarian assistance from entering Gaza.

One thing Lush can currently send into Gaza is our love and a strong message that we stand in solidarity.

This will take the form of halting business-as-usual by shutting our UK shops, website and factories for one day on Wednesday 3rd September 2025, with our shop windows displaying the message STOP STARVING GAZA – WE ARE CLOSED IN SOLIDARITY."</p>
